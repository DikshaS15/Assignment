        "Ans-1. **The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation**: This refers to the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, called an object. Encapsulation promotes data hiding, which is essential for protecting the integrity of data and preventing unintended modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Inheritance**: This allows you to create new classes (called subclasses) that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes (called superclasses). Inheritance promotes code reuse and hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Polymorphism**: This refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same message in different ways. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a different implementation of a method inherited from its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Abstraction**: This involves focusing on the essential characteristics of an object while ignoring the irrelevant details. Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which define the common behavior of a group of objects without providing specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Association**: This refers to the relationship between objects, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. Association is used to model the interactions and dependencies between objects in a system.\n",
